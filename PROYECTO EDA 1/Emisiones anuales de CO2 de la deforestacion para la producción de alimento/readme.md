# Annual CO₂ emissions from deforestation for food production - Data package

This data package contains the data that powers the chart ["Annual CO₂ emissions from deforestation for food production"](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-deforestation-for-food?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=false) on the Our World in Data website. It was downloaded on December 09, 2025.

### Active Filters

A filtered subset of the full data was downloaded. The following filters were applied:

## CSV Structure

The high level structure of the CSV file is that each row is an observation for an entity (usually a country or region) and a timepoint (usually a year).

The first two columns in the CSV file are "Entity" and "Code". "Entity" is the name of the entity (e.g. "United States"). "Code" is the OWID internal entity code that we use if the entity is a country or region. For normal countries, this is the same as the [iso alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) code of the entity (e.g. "USA") - for non-standard countries like historical countries these are custom codes.

The third column is either "Year" or "Day". If the data is annual, this is "Year" and contains only the year as an integer. If the column is "Day", the column contains a date string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD".

The final column is the data column, which is the time series that powers the chart. If the CSV data is downloaded using the "full data" option, then the column corresponds to the time series below. If the CSV data is downloaded using the "only selected data visible in the chart" option then the data column is transformed depending on the chart type and thus the association with the time series might not be as straightforward.

## Metadata.json structure

The .metadata.json file contains metadata about the data package. The "charts" key contains information to recreate the chart, like the title, subtitle etc.. The "columns" key contains information about each of the columns in the csv, like the unit, timespan covered, citation for the data etc..

## About the data

Our World in Data is almost never the original producer of the data - almost all of the data we use has been compiled by others. If you want to re-use data, it is your responsibility to ensure that you adhere to the sources' license and to credit them correctly. Please note that a single time series may have more than one source - e.g. when we stich together data from different time periods by different producers or when we calculate per capita metrics using population data from a second source.

## Detailed information about the data


## Deforestation carbon footprint for food production
This measures the amount of CO₂ emissions linked to deforestation for food production – it is trade-adjusted so reflects the carbon footprint of diets within a given country. It is based on the annual average over the period from 2010 to 2014.
Unit conversion factor: 1000000

### Additional information about this data
Pendrill et al. (2019) developed a land-balance model which attributed detected forest loss across the world to the expansion of croplands, pasture and tree plantations. This is then linked to particular agricultural commodities based on national land use, crop and forest product statistics published in the UN Food and Agricultural Organization balance sheets.

This study also maps deforestation and related CO2 emissions embedded in the international trade of these products using both a physical trade model, and a MRIO (multi-regional input-output) model. This allows for the quantification of deforestation and related emissions embedded in imported food and forestry products.
